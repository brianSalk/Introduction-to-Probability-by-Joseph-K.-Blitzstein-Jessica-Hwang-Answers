        Alice and Bob arrange to meet for lunch on a certain day at noon. However, neither is
known for punctuality. They both arrive independently at uniformly distributed times
between noon and 1 pm on that day. Each is willing to wait up to 15 minutes for the
other to show up. What is the probability they will meet for lunch that day?
