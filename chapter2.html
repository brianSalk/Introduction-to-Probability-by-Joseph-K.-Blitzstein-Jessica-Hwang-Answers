  <h1>Chapter Two Answers</h1>

<h2>Question 4</h2>
<details>
    Fred is answering a multiple-choice problem on an exam, and has to choose one of n
options (exactly one of which is correct). Let K be the event that he knows the answer,
and R be the event that he gets the problem right (either through knowledge or through
luck). Suppose that if he knows the right answer he will definitely get the problem right,
but if he does not know then he will guess completely randomly. Let P(K) = p.<br><br>
(a) Find P(K|R) (in terms of p and n).<br>
(b) Show that P(K|R) â‰¥ p, and explain why this makes sense intuitively. When (if ever)
does P(K|R) equal p?
  <summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
  A)
  $$
  P(K|R) = \dfrac{p}{p + (1-p)/n}
  $$
    B) Intuitivly, 
    \(P(K|R)\) will always be greater than or equal to \(p\) because getting the answer right is usually evidence in favor of knowlege.<br>
    When \(p=1\) or \(p=0\), then \(P(K|R)=p\)
  <summary>Answer</summary>
</details>

<details>
    This equation might not look like Bayes because \(P(R|K) = 1\), and therefore we can implicitly multiply by 1.

    <summary>Question</summary>

    $$
    P(D|H) = \dfrac{.01}{(.01)+(.99 \cdot .5^7)} \approx 0.564
    $$
    <summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
    First let's define our events
    \(
    D = \text{double-sided coin selected}
    \)
    \(
    H = seven heads in a row
    \)
    We are told that \(P(D) = .01\) and \(P(H|D) = 1\).  With a bit of common sense we can finish building this equation
    $$
    P(D|H) = \dfrac{P(H) \cdot P(H|D)}{P(D) \cdot P(H|D) + P(D^c) \cdot .5^7}
    $$
    \(.5^7\) is the probability of flipping a fair coin 7 times and getting heads heach time.

    A)
    $$
	P(D|H) = \dfrac{\dfrac{1}{2} \left(\dfrac{99}{100} \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^7 + \dfrac{1}{100}\right)}
	{\dfrac{1}{2} \left(\dfrac{99}{100} \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^7 + \dfrac{1}{100}\right) + \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^8 } \approx .694
    $$
    B)
    $$
    P(D|H) = \dfrac{.005}{.005 + (.995 \cdot .5^7)} \approx .391

<h2>Question 8</h2>
<details>
	The screens used for a certain type of cell phone are manufactured by 3 companies,
A, B, and C. The proportions of screens supplied by A, B, and C are 0.5, 0.3, and
0.2, respectively, and their screens are defective with probabilities 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03,
respectively. Given that the screen on such a phone is defective, what is the probability
that Company A manufactured it?
	<summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
	$$
	P(A|D) = \dfrac{\frac{1}{200} }{\frac{1}{200} + 2(\frac{3}{500}) } = \dfrac{5}{17}
	$$
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	The numerator is the probability that a screen made by company A is defective times the probability that a screen is made by company A, which is \(.5 \cdot .01\) or \(\dfrac{1}{200}\)<br>
	The denominator is the probability that any screen is defective.  We find this by adding up the probability of each company making a screen and probability that a screen by that company is defective.

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<details>
	(a) Show that if events A1 and A2 have the same prior probability P (A1) = P (A2),
A1 implies B, and A2 implies B, then A1 and A2 have the same posterior probability
P (A1|B) = P (A2|B) if it is observed that B occurred.<br>
(b) Explain why (a) makes sense intuitively, and give a concrete example.
	<summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
	A)<br>
	If two events have the same prior probability, that means they are equally likely to happen.  If they both imply the same event and that event happens, that just means the probability of each event stays the same.<br>
	B) <br>
	If there is a 10 percent chance of rain and a 10 percent chance of thunder, and both events imply clouds, then the fact that it is cloudy changes nothing.
