  <h1>Chapter Two Answers</h1>

<h2>Question 4</h2>
<details>
    Fred is answering a multiple-choice problem on an exam, and has to choose one of n
options (exactly one of which is correct). Let K be the event that he knows the answer,
and R be the event that he gets the problem right (either through knowledge or through
luck). Suppose that if he knows the right answer he will definitely get the problem right,
but if he does not know then he will guess completely randomly. Let P(K) = p.<br><br>
(a) Find P(K|R) (in terms of p and n).<br>
(b) Show that P(K|R) â‰¥ p, and explain why this makes sense intuitively. When (if ever)
does P(K|R) equal p?
  <summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
  A)
  $$
  P(K|R) = \dfrac{p}{p + (1-p)/n}
  $$
    B) Intuitivly, 
    \(P(K|R)\) will always be greater than or equal to \(p\) because getting the answer right is usually evidence in favor of knowlege.<br>
    When \(p=1\) or \(p=0\), then \(P(K|R)=p\)

<details>
    This equation might not look like Bayes because \(P(R|K) = 1\), and therefore we can implicitly multiply by 1.

    <summary>Question</summary>

    $$
    P(D|H) = \dfrac{.01}{(.01)+(.99 \cdot .5^7)} \approx 0.564
    $$
    <summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
    First let's define our events
    \(
    D = \text{double-sided coin selected}
    \)
    \(
    H = seven heads in a row
    \)
    We are told that \(P(D) = .01\) and \(P(H|D) = 1\).  With a bit of common sense we can finish building this equation
    $$
    P(D|H) = \dfrac{P(H) \cdot P(H|D)}{P(D) \cdot P(H|D) + P(D^c) \cdot .5^7}
    $$
    \(.5^7\) is the probability of flipping a fair coin 7 times and getting heads heach time.

<h2>Question 7</h2>

    <summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
    A)
    $$
	P(D|H) = \dfrac{\dfrac{1}{2} \left(\dfrac{99}{100} \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^7 + \dfrac{1}{100}\right)}
	{\dfrac{1}{2} \left(\dfrac{99}{100} \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^7 + \dfrac{1}{100}\right) + \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^8 } \approx .694
    $$
    B)
    $$
    P(D|H) = \dfrac{.005}{.005 + (.995 \cdot .5^7)} \approx .391
    $$
