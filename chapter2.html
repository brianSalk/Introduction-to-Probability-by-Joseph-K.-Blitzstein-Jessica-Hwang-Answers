<h2>Question 4</h2>
<details>
    Fred is answering a multiple-choice problem on an exam, and has to choose one of n
options (exactly one of which is correct). Let K be the event that he knows the answer,
and R be the event that he gets the problem right (either through knowledge or through
luck). Suppose that if he knows the right answer he will definitely get the problem right,
but if he does not know then he will guess completely randomly. Let P(K) = p.<br><br>
(a) Find P(K|R) (in terms of p and n).<br>
(b) Show that P(K|R) ≥ p, and explain why this makes sense intuitively. When (if ever)
does P(K|R) equal p?
  <summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
  A)
  $$
  P(K|R) = \dfrac{p}{p + (1-p)/n}
  $$
    B) Intuitivly, 
    \(P(K|R)\) will always be greater than or equal to \(p\) because getting the answer right is usually evidence in favor of knowlege.<br>
    When \(p=1\) or \(p=0\), then \(P(K|R)=p\)
  <summary>Answer</summary>
</details>

<details>
    This equation might not look like Bayes because \(P(R|K) = 1\), and therefore we can implicitly multiply by 1.

    $$
    P(D|H) = \dfrac{.01}{(.01)+(.99 \cdot .5^7)} \approx 0.564
    $$
    <summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
    First let's define our events
    \(
    D = \text{double-sided coin selected}
    \)
    \(
    H = seven heads in a row
    \)
    We are told that \(P(D) = .01\) and \(P(H|D) = 1\).  With a bit of common sense we can finish building this equation
    $$
    P(D|H) = \dfrac{P(H) \cdot P(H|D)}{P(D) \cdot P(H|D) + P(D^c) \cdot .5^7}
    $$
    \(.5^7\) is the probability of flipping a fair coin 7 times and getting heads heach time.

    A)
    $$
	P(D|H) = \dfrac{\dfrac{1}{2} \left(\dfrac{99}{100} \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^7 + \dfrac{1}{100}\right)}
	{\dfrac{1}{2} \left(\dfrac{99}{100} \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^7 + \dfrac{1}{100}\right) + \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^8 } \approx .694

    B)
    $$
    P(D|H) = \dfrac{.005}{.005 + (.995 \cdot .5^7)} \approx .391

<h2>Question 8</h2>
<details>
	The screens used for a certain type of cell phone are manufactured by 3 companies,
A, B, and C. The proportions of screens supplied by A, B, and C are 0.5, 0.3, and
0.2, respectively, and their screens are defective with probabilities 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03,
respectively. Given that the screen on such a phone is defective, what is the probability
that Company A manufactured it?
	<summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
	$$
	P(A|D) = \dfrac{\frac{1}{200} }{\frac{1}{200} + 2(\frac{3}{500}) } = \dfrac{5}{17}
	$$
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	The numerator is the probability that a screen made by company A is defective times the probability that a screen is made by company A, which is \(.5 \cdot .01\) or \(\dfrac{1}{200}\)<br>
	The denominator is the probability that any screen is defective.  We find this by adding up the probability of each company making a screen and probability that a screen by that company is defective.

	(a) Show that if events A1 and A2 have the same prior probability P (A1) = P (A2),
A1 implies B, and A2 implies B, then A1 and A2 have the same posterior probability
P (A1|B) = P (A2|B) if it is observed that B occurred.<br>
(b) Explain why (a) makes sense intuitively, and give a concrete example.
	<summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
	A)<br>
	If two events have the same prior probability, that means they are equally likely to happen.  If they both imply the same event and that event happens, that just means the probability of each event stays the same.<br>
	B) <br>
	If there is a 10 percent chance of rain and a 10 percent chance of thunder, and both events imply clouds, then the fact that it is cloudy changes nothing.

<h2>Question 10</h2>
<details>
	Fred is working on a major project. In planning the project, two milestones are set up,
with dates by which they should be accomplished. This serves as a way to track Fred’s
progress. Let A1 be the event that Fred completes the first milestone on time, A2 be
the event that he completes the second milestone on time, and A3 be the event that he
completes the project on time.
Suppose that \(P(A_{j+1}|A_j )=0.8\) but \(P(Aj+1|A^c_j )=0.3\) for j = 1, 2, 3. If Fred falls
behind on his schedule it will be hard for him to get caught up. Also, assume that the
second milestone supersedes the first, in the sense that once we know whether he is
on time in completing the second milestone, it no longer matters what happened with
the first milestone. We can express this by saying that \(A_1\) and \(A_3\) are conditionally
independent given \(A_2\) and they’re also conditionally independent given \(A^c_2\).
<br><br>
(a) Find the probability that Fred will finish the project on time, given that he completes
the first milestone on time. Also find the probability that Fred will finish the project on
time, given that he is late for the first milestone.<br>
(b) Suppose that P(A1)=0.75. Find the probability that Fred will finish the project
on time.

	A)
	$$
	P(A_3|A_1) = .8^2 + .2(.3) = .7
	$$
	$$
	P(A_3|A_1^c) = .3(.8) + .7(.3) = .45
	$$
	B)
	$$
	P(A_3) = 0.75 \cdot 0.8 \cdot 0.8 + 0.75 \cdot 0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.25 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.8 + 0.25 \cdot 0.7 \cdot 0.3 = .6375
	$$
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	A)<br>
	Let's break this down at into smaller parts.  First we look at the probabilies for event \(A_2\)
	$$
	P(A_2|A_1) = .8
	$$
	$$
	P(A_2^c|A_1) = .2
	$$
	$$
	P(A_3|P_2) = .8P(A_2|A_1)
	$$
	$$
	P(A_3|P_2^c) = .3P(A_2^c|A_1)
	$$
	$$
	P(A_3|P_1) = P(A_3|P_2^c) + P(A_3|P_2)
	$$
	When we plug in the values for the right-hand side of that equation, we get the answer.  Notice that we only end up with two cases being added, this is because \(A_2\) and \(A_2^c\) are mutually exclusive.<br>
	<br>
	We do the same thing for \(P(A_3|A_1^c)\) except the values are
	$$
	P(A_2|A_1^c) = .3
	$$
	$$
	P(A_2^c|A_1^c) = .7
	$$
	$$
	P(A_3|A_2) = .8P(A_2|A_1^c)
	$$
	$$
	P(A_3|A_2^c) = .3P(A_2^c|A_1^c)
	$$
	Now we have everything we need to solve for \(P(A_3|A_1^c)\)<br><br>
	B)<br>
	Now we will have four cases to add together, they are
	$$
	P(A_3|A_2,A_1) = .75(.8 \times .8)
	$$
