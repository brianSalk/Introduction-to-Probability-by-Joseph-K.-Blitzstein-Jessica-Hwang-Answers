<h2>Question 4</h2>
<details>
    Fred is answering a multiple-choice problem on an exam, and has to choose one of n
options (exactly one of which is correct). Let K be the event that he knows the answer,
and R be the event that he gets the problem right (either through knowledge or through
luck). Suppose that if he knows the right answer he will definitely get the problem right,
but if he does not know then he will guess completely randomly. Let P(K) = p.<br><br>
(a) Find P(K|R) (in terms of p and n).<br>
(b) Show that P(K|R) ≥ p, and explain why this makes sense intuitively. When (if ever)
does P(K|R) equal p?
  <summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
  A)
  $$
  P(K|R) = \dfrac{p}{p + (1-p)/n}
  $$
    B) Intuitivly, 
    \(P(K|R)\) will always be greater than or equal to \(p\) because getting the answer right is usually evidence in favor of knowlege.<br>
    When \(p=1\) or \(p=0\), then \(P(K|R)=p\)
  <summary>Answer</summary>
</details>

<details>
    This equation might not look like Bayes because \(P(R|K) = 1\), and therefore we can implicitly multiply by 1.

    $$
    P(D|H) = \dfrac{.01}{(.01)+(.99 \cdot .5^7)} \approx 0.564
    $$
    <summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
    First let's define our events
    \(
    D = \text{double-sided coin selected}
    \)
    \(
    H = seven heads in a row
    \)
    We are told that \(P(D) = .01\) and \(P(H|D) = 1\).  With a bit of common sense we can finish building this equation
    $$
    P(D|H) = \dfrac{P(H) \cdot P(H|D)}{P(D) \cdot P(H|D) + P(D^c) \cdot .5^7}
    $$
    \(.5^7\) is the probability of flipping a fair coin 7 times and getting heads heach time.

<h2>Question 8</h2>
<details>
	The screens used for a certain type of cell phone are manufactured by 3 companies,
A, B, and C. The proportions of screens supplied by A, B, and C are 0.5, 0.3, and
0.2, respectively, and their screens are defective with probabilities 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03,
respectively. Given that the screen on such a phone is defective, what is the probability
that Company A manufactured it?
	<summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
	$$
	P(A|D) = \dfrac{\frac{1}{200} }{\frac{1}{200} + 2(\frac{3}{500}) } = \dfrac{5}{17}
	$$
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	The numerator is the probability that a screen made by company A is defective times the probability that a screen is made by company A, which is \(.5 \cdot .01\) or \(\dfrac{1}{200}\)<br>
	The denominator is the probability that any screen is defective.  We find this by adding up the probability of each company making a screen and probability that a screen by that company is defective.

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<details>
	(a) Show that if events A1 and A2 have the same prior probability P (A1) = P (A2),
A1 implies B, and A2 implies B, then A1 and A2 have the same posterior probability
P (A1|B) = P (A2|B) if it is observed that B occurred.<br>
(b) Explain why (a) makes sense intuitively, and give a concrete example.
	<summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
	A)<br>
	If two events have the same prior probability, that means they are equally likely to happen.  If they both imply the same event and that event happens, that just means the probability of each event stays the same.<br>
	B) <br>
	If there is a 10 percent chance of rain and a 10 percent chance of thunder, and both events imply clouds, then the fact that it is cloudy changes nothing.

<h2>Question 10</h2>
<details>
	Fred is working on a major project. In planning the project, two milestones are set up,
with dates by which they should be accomplished. This serves as a way to track Fred’s
progress. Let A1 be the event that Fred completes the first milestone on time, A2 be
the event that he completes the second milestone on time, and A3 be the event that he
completes the project on time.
Suppose that \(P(A_{j+1}|A_j )=0.8\) but \(P(Aj+1|A^c_j )=0.3\) for j = 1, 2, 3. If Fred falls
behind on his schedule it will be hard for him to get caught up. Also, assume that the
second milestone supersedes the first, in the sense that once we know whether he is
on time in completing the second milestone, it no longer matters what happened with
the first milestone. We can express this by saying that \(A_1\) and \(A_3\) are conditionally
independent given \(A_2\) and they’re also conditionally independent given \(A^c_2\).
<br><br>
(a) Find the probability that Fred will finish the project on time, given that he completes
the first milestone on time. Also find the probability that Fred will finish the project on
time, given that he is late for the first milestone.<br>
(b) Suppose that P(A1)=0.75. Find the probability that Fred will finish the project
on time.

	A)
	$$
	P(A_3|A_1) = .8^2 + .2(.3) = .7
	$$
	$$
	P(A_3|A_1^c) = .3(.8) + .7(.3) = .45
	$$
	B)
	$$
	P(A_3) = 0.75 \cdot 0.8 \cdot 0.8 + 0.75 \cdot 0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.25 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.8 + 0.25 \cdot 0.7 \cdot 0.3 = .6375
	$$
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	A)<br>
	Let's break this down at into smaller parts.  First we look at the probabilies for event \(A_2\)
	$$
	P(A_2|A_1) = .8
	$$
	$$
	P(A_2^c|A_1) = .2
	$$
	$$
	P(A_3|P_2) = .8P(A_2|A_1)
	$$
	$$
	P(A_3|P_2^c) = .3P(A_2^c|A_1)
	$$
	$$
	P(A_3|P_1) = P(A_3|P_2^c) + P(A_3|P_2)
	$$
	When we plug in the values for the right-hand side of that equation, we get the answer.  Notice that we only end up with two cases being added, this is because \(A_2\) and \(A_2^c\) are mutually exclusive.<br>
	<br>
	We do the same thing for \(P(A_3|A_1^c)\) except the values are
	$$
	P(A_2|A_1^c) = .3
	$$
	$$
	P(A_2^c|A_1^c) = .7
	$$
	$$
	P(A_3|A_2) = .8P(A_2|A_1^c)
	$$
	$$
	P(A_3|A_2^c) = .3P(A_2^c|A_1^c)
	$$
	Now we have everything we need to solve for \(P(A_3|A_1^c)\)<br><br>
	B)<br>
	Now we will have four cases to add together, they are
	$$
	P(A_3|A_2,A_1) = .75(.8 \times .8)
	$$
	$$
	P(A_3|A_2,A_1^c) = .25(.3 \times .8)
	$$
	$$
	P(A_3|A_2^c|A_1) = .75(.2 \times .3)
	$$
	$$
	P(A_3|A_2^c|A_1^c) = .25(.7 \times .3)
	$$
	The sum of these will gie us the answer for \(P(A_3)\).

<h2>Question 11</h2>
<details>
	An exit poll in an election is a survey taken of voters just after they have voted. One
major use of exit polls has been so that news organizations can try to figure out as soon as possible who won the election, before the votes are officially counted. This has
been notoriously inaccurate in various elections, sometimes because of selection bias:
the sample of people who are invited to and agree to participate in the survey may not
be similar enough to the overall population of voters.
Consider an election with two candidates, Candidate A and Candidate B. Every voter
is invited to participate in an exit poll, where they are asked whom they voted for; some
accept and some refuse. For a randomly selected voter, let A be the event that they voted
for A, and W be the event that they are willing to participate in the exit poll. Suppose
that P(W|A)=0.7 but P(W|A
c
)=0.3. In the exit poll, 60% of the respondents say
they voted for A (assume that they are all honest), suggesting a comfortable victory for
A. Find P(A), the true proportion of people who voted for A.
	<summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
	$$
	P(A) \approx .391
	$$
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	To find \(P(A)\), we find the equation for \(P(A|W)\) and then solve for \(P(A)\).
	$$
	P(A|W) = \dfrac{.7x}{.7x + .3(1-x)} = .6
	$$
	Noticed I replaced \(P(A)\) with \(x\) for clarity.<br>
	Now solve for \(x\) to get the answer.

<h2>Question 12</h2>
<details>
	Alice is trying to communicate with Bob, by sending a message (encoded in binary)
across a channel.<br><br>
(a) Suppose for this part that she sends only one bit (a 0 or 1), with equal probabilities.
If she sends a 0, there is a 5% chance of an error occurring, resulting in Bob receiving a
1; if she sends a 1, there is a 10% chance of an error occurring, resulting in Bob receiving
a 0. Given that Bob receives a 1, what is the probability that Alice actually sent a 1?<br>
(b) To reduce the chance of miscommunication, Alice and Bob decide to use a repetition
code. Again Alice wants to convey a 0 or a 1, but this time she repeats it two more times,
so that she sends 000 to convey 0 and 111 to convey 1. Bob will decode the message by
going with what the majority of the bits were. Assume that the error probabilities are
as in (a), with error events for different bits independent of each other. Given that Bob
receives 110, what is the probability that Alice intended to convey a 1?
