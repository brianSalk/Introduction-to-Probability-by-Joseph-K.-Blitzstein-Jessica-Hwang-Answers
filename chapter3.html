<h2>Question 1</h2>
<details>
	People are arriving at a party one at a time. While waiting for more people to arrive
they entertain themselves by comparing their birthdays. Let X be the number of people
needed to obtain a birthday match, i.e., before person X arrives there are no two people
with the same birthday, but when person X arrives there is a match. Find the PMF of
X.

	$$
	\dfrac{x-1}{365} \prod_{i=1}^{363} \dfrac{365-i}{365} 
	$$
	Where \(x\) is between 2 and 365 <br>
	There are simpler ways to write this without sigma notation, I will leave that to the readers to figure out (not because I am lazy)
	<summary>Answer</summary>

	P(person number x is the first person to have same birthday) = P(noone has same birthday)P(last person has same birthday as x-1 pervious)

<h2>Question 2</h2>
<details>
	(a) Independent Bernoulli trials are performed, with probability 1/2 of success, until
	there has been at least one success. Find the PMF of the number of trials performed.<br>
(b) Independent Bernoulli trials are performed, with probability 1/2 of success, until
there has been at least one success and at least one failure. Find the PMF of the number
of trials performed.

	A) 
	$$
	p_X(x) = P(X = x) = \dfrac{1}{2^x}
	$$
	Where \(x\) is the number of bernouli trials before a success
	B)
	$$
	p_X(x) = P(X = x) = \begin{cases}
	\dfrac{x-1}{2^{(x-1)}} & \text{if} x > 1 \\
	0 & \text{otherwise}

	$$
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	A) Count the number of ways you can flip a coin \(x\) times and have the first \(x-1\) flips be tails and the last flip be heads.  There is only one way to do this but there are \(2^x\) possible other ways for the coin to land.<br>
	B) Count the number of ways that you can have either all heads and the last flip is tails or <em>vis-versa</em> with at least two flips.<br>

<h2>Question 3</h2>
<details>Let X be an r.v. with CDF F , and Y = μ + σX, where μ and σ are real numbers with
σ > 0. (Then Y is called a location-scale transformation of X; we will encounter this
concept many times in Chapter 5 and beyond.) Find the CDF of Y , in terms of F

<details>
	$$
	F_Y(y) = F_X(\dfrac{y-\mu}{\sigma})
	$$
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	When it asks us to find Y in terms of F, it is asking us to define a new function \(F_Y\) that uses our new variable \(Y\) instead of \(X\).<br>
	First write \(F\).<br>
	$$
	F_X(x) = P(X = x)
	$$
	now write out \(F_Y\)
	$$
	F_Y(y) = P(Y = y)
	$$
	Now sub \(Y\) with \(Y = \mu + \sigma X\)
	$$
	F_Y(y) = P(\mu + \sigma X = y)
	$$
	And re-write with \(F\)
	$$
	F_Y(y) = F_X(\dfrac{y- \mu}{\sigma})
	$$

<h2>Question 4</h2>
<details>Let n be a positive integer and
	$$
	F(x) = \dfrac{\lfloor x \rfloor}{n}
	$$
	for \(0 \le x \le n, F (x) = 0\) for x \(\lt\) 0, and F (x) = 1 for x \(\gt\) n, where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is the greatest
integer less than or equal to x. Show that F is a CDF, and find the PMF that it
corresponds to.

	<summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
	We can prove that \(\dfrac{\lfloor x \rfloor }{n}\) is a CDF because it is non-decreasing and it sums to 1.<br>
	We can find its PDF by finding each value for \(F(x) - F(x-1)\).  Using the above function, 
	$$
		F(0) = 0
	$$
	$$ F(1) - F(0) = \frac{1}{n}
	$$
	$$
	F(2) - F(1) = \frac{1}{n}
	$$
	therefore, the PMF of \(F(x) = \dfrac{\lfloor x \rfloor}{n}\) is \(\dfrAC{1}{n}\)

<h2>Question 5</h2>
<details>(a) Show that p(n) = \((\frac{1}{2})^{n+1})\)
 for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . is a valid PMF for a discrete r.v.
(b)<br> Find the CDF of a random variable with the PMF from (a).
	<summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
	A) 	We can show that this is a PMF by seeing that the limit when n = \(\infty\) is 1 and that all values in the given domain are non-negative<br>
	$$
	\lim_{n \to \infty} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n+1} = 1
	$$
	B) We get the CDF by adding all values from \(0\) to \(n\)
	$$
	\sum_{i=0}^{n} \dfrac{1}{2^{n+1}} = \dfrac{2^{n+1}-1}{2^{n+1}}
	$$

<h2>Question 7</h2>
<details>
	Bob is playing a video game that has 7 levels. He starts at level 1, and has probability
p1 of reaching level 2. In general, given that he reaches level j, he has probability \(p_j\) of
reaching level \(j + 1\), for \(1 \le j \le 6\). Let X be the highest level that he reaches. Find the
PMF of X (in terms of \(p_1\), \(\ldots\) , \(p_6\)).
	<summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
	$$
	p_X(x) = \begin{cases}
	1-p_1 & \text{if } x = 1 \\
	(1-p_{x+1}) \prod_{i=1}^{x} p_j & \text{if } x \in \{2,3,4,5,6\} \\
	\prod_{i=1}^{x} p_j & \text{if } x = 7 \\
	0 & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
	$$
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	The probability that the highest level the highest level he reaced is \(j\), that means he reached level \(j\) but not level \(j+1\).  There are several cases because he could reach the last level or only the first (lose right away).  We also want to include the implicit case that X is not in the domain.

<h2>Question 8</h2>
<detials>
	There are 100 prizes, with one worth $1, one worth $2, \(\ldots\) , and one worth $100. There
are 100 boxes, each of which contains one of the prizes. You get 5 prizes by picking random boxes one at a time, without replacement. Find the PMF of how much your
most valuable prize is worth (as a simple expression in terms of binomial coefficients).
	<summary>Question</summary>
</detials>
<details>
	$$
	P_X(X = x) = f(x) = \dfrac{ {x \choose 5}5! }{100 \choose 5}
	$$
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	There are \(5\) numbers being selected, therefore we have \(5!\)<br>
	There are \({x \choose 5}\) ways for \(x\) to be the highest number selected.<br>
	There are \({100 \choose 5}\) total ways to select \(5\) numbers of \(100\).
