<h2>Question 1</h2>
<details>
	People are arriving at a party one at a time. While waiting for more people to arrive
they entertain themselves by comparing their birthdays. Let X be the number of people
needed to obtain a birthday match, i.e., before person X arrives there are no two people
with the same birthday, but when person X arrives there is a match. Find the PMF of
X.

	$$
	\dfrac{x-1}{365} \prod_{i=1}^{363} \dfrac{365-i}{365} 
	$$
	Where \(x\) is between 2 and 365 <br>
	There are simpler ways to write this without sigma notation, I will leave that to the readers to figure out (not because I am lazy)

<details>
	P(person number x is the first person to have same birthday) = P(noone has same birthday)P(last person has same birthday as x-1 pervious)

<h2>Question 2</h2>
<details>
	(a) Independent Bernoulli trials are performed, with probability 1/2 of success, until
	there has been at least one success. Find the PMF of the number of trials performed.<br>
(b) Independent Bernoulli trials are performed, with probability 1/2 of success, until
there has been at least one success and at least one failure. Find the PMF of the number
of trials performed.

	A) 
	$$
	p_X(x) = P(X = x) = \dfrac{1}{2^x}
	$$
	Where \(x\) is the number of bernouli trials before 
	B)
	$$
	p_X(x) = P(X = x) = \begin{cases}
	\dfrac{x-1}{2^{(x-1)}} & \text{if} x > 1 \\
	0 & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
	$$

</details>
<details>
	A) Count the number of ways you can flip a coin \(x\) times and have the first \(x-1\) flips be tails and the last flip be heads.  There is only one way to do this but there are \(2^x\) possible other ways for the coin to land.<br>
	B) Count the number of ways that you can have either all heads and the last flip is tails or <em>vis-versa<em> with at least two flips.<br>
