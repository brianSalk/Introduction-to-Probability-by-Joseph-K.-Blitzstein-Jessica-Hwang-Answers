  <h2>Question 1</h2>
  <details>How many ways are there to permute the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI?<summary>Question</summary></details>
  <details>$${11 \choose 4,4,2} = 34,650 $$<summary>Answer</summary></details>
  <details>For this problem, we use multinomial theorem.<br>
  We have 4 Ss, 4 Is, and 2 Ps, this leaves us with <br>
    $${11 \choose 4,4,2} = 34,650$$ permutations of the word MISSISSIPPI.<summary>Details</summary></details>
    
  <h2>Question 2</h2>
    <details>(a) How many 7-digit phone numbers are possible, assuming that the first digit can’t
be a 0 or a 1?
(b) Re-solve (a), except now assume also that the phone number is not allowed to start
with 911 (since this is reserved for emergency use, and it would not be desirable for the
system to wait to see whether more digits were going to be dialed after someone has
dialed 911).<summary>Question</summary></details>
    <details>A) $$ 8 \cdot 10^6 = 8,000,000$$
        b)
        $$ 8 \cdot 10^6 - 10^4 = 7,990,000$$<summary>Answer</summary></details>
    <details>a) first digit can be 2-9, other 6 digits can be 0-10<br>
        b) there are 1,000 4 digit numbers (including numbers that start with 0), subtract those from part a<summary>Explaination</summary></details>

    <h2>Question 3</h2>
    <details>Fred is planning to go out to dinner each night of a certain week, Monday through
Friday, with each dinner being at one of his ten favorite restaurants.
(a) How many possibilities are there for Fred’s schedule of dinners for that Monday
through Friday, if Fred is not willing to eat at the same restaurant more than once?
(b) How many possibilities are there for Fred’s schedule of dinners for that Monday
through Friday, if Fred is willing to eat at the same restaurant more than once, but is
not willing to eat at the same place twice in a row (or more)?<summary>Question</summary></details>

	<details>a) $$ {}^{10}P_5 = 30,240 $$ b) $$ 10 \cdot 9^4 = 65,610$$<summary>Answer</summary></details>

	<h2>Question 4</h2>
	<details>
A round-robin tournament is being held with n tennis players; this means that every player will play against every other player exactly once.
(a) How many possible outcomes are there for the tournament (the outcome lists out who won and who lost for each game)?
(b) How many games are played in total?<summary>Question</summary></details>

	<details>a)$$ 2 \cdot {n \choose 2} $$ b) $$ {n \choose 2} $$ <summary>Answer</summary></details>
	<details>
		a) We are counting ordered pairs<br>
		b) We are couting the number of pairs of players<summary>Explaination</summary></details>
<h2>Question 5</h2>
<details>
	A)
	$$
	n-1
	$$
	B)
	$$
	\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^i 
	$$
	C)
	$$
	2^n - 1
	$$
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	A) Draw the bracket to gain an intuition.<br>
	B) Each round has half the number of the previous round, starting with \(2^{n-1}\)<br>
	C) There are \(2^{n-1}\) players and each game eliminates one player until one final winner is left, this means we must play \(2^{n} -1 \) games.
	<summary>Explaination</summary>
</details>
<h2>Question 6</h2>
<details>
	$$
	2 {20 \choose 2}	
	$$
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	There are 20 players and we are counting pairs of players, that is how we got \({20 \choose 2}\), then we need to count the possibility that each player is either black or white, that gives us the \(2\).
	<summary>Explaination</summary>
</details>

<h2>Question 7</h2>
<details>
	A)
	$$
	{7 \choose 3, 2, 2} = 210
	$$
	B)
	$$
	{7 \choose 4}
	$$
	C)
	$$
	{6 \choose 3}
	$$
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	A) Use multinomial coefficient because we have 3 different outcomes, 3 wins, 2 loses and 2 ties.<br>
	B) We count all the ways player a gets 4 wins and player b gets 3 wins out of 7 games.  Because there are no ties, this is just 7 choose 4 (or 7 choose 3)<br>
	C) Because we must play 7 games and player a must win 4 to 3, the 7th game must be won by player a.  There are 6 choose 3 ways for her to win the other games.

</details>

<h2>Question 8</h2>
<details>
	$$
	\dfrac{{12 \choose 2,5,5}}{2}
	$$
<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	There are 12 people and we want to place them into 3 teams of sizes 2,5, and 5.  Because two of these teams are the same size, we must then divide by 2!
<summary>Explaination</summary>
</details>

<h2>Question 9</h2>
<details>
	$$
	{110 + 111 \choose 110}
	$$
	B)
	$$
	{110 + 111 \choose 110} \cdot {200 \choose 100}
	$$
<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	A) 
	To find the number of paths from \( (x_1,y_1) \) to \( (x_2, y_2) \) on a grid, you count the ways you can use:
	$$
	{x_2 - x_1 + y_2 - y_1 \choose x_2 - x_1}
	$$
	because you need to sideways \(x_2 - x_1\) times and up or down \( y_2 - y_1 \) times.  <br>
	You must go up and right an additional 100, but still need to cross (110, 111), so multiply part a by:
	$$
	{200 \choose 100}
	$$
<summary>Explaination</summary>
</details>

<h2>Question 10</h2>
<details>
	A)
	$$
	\sum_{i=1}^{5} {5 \choose i} \cdot {15 \choose 7-i}
	$$
	OR
	$$
	{20 \choose 7} - {15 \choose 7}
	$$
	B) The provided solution is wrong because when we choose 6 from 19, we might choose the same one we selected from the stats class.  In other words, this approach chooses one class twice.
<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	A) We can either do case work, selected 1 of the 5 stats courses then 6 of the remaining courses.  Then 2 of the stats courses and 5 of the remaining 15 courses and so on, but a simpler approach is to just subtract all the combinations including no stats courses from all possible combinations.<br>

	$$
	{}^mP_n
	$$
<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	for part A, we just need to map each value in set A to any value in set B.  This is the same question as "You have a password of length n and an alphabet of m characters, how many unique passwords can be created"<br>
	For part B, we must map each value of set A to a different value in set B, this is the same as "there are a total of m people, how many unique orderings of length n can they form".

<h2>Question 12</h2>
<details>
	A)
	$$
	{52 \choose 13}
	$$
	B)

	{52 \choose 13,13,13,13}
	$$
	C) $${52 \choose 13}^4$$ counts the number of overall hands if everyone pulled from a different deck of 52 cards.
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	A) we choose 13 or 52 cards, this is basically a tautology<br>
	B) If the deck is split 4 ways and each person gets 13 cards, we use multinomial theorem.<br>

<h2>Question 23</h2>
<details>
	$$
	\dfrac{3! \cdot 6}{3^8}
	$$
<summary>Explaination</summary>
</details>
<details>
	We divide the number of successes by the total number of outcomes, where a success is defined as all three people chosing adjacent floors.  There are \(3!\) ways of arranging 3 people and there are 6 places to put each ordering.  To calculate the total number of outcomes, we need to consider that each person can go to one of 8 floors, leaving us with \(3^8\)

<h2>Question 29</h2>
<details>
	A)
	$$
	\gt
	$$
	B)
	$$
	=
	$$
		
<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	A) We could answer this question in several ways, some of which may involve tedious math.<br>
	If we have some insights about the distribution of the sums of numbers dice faces we can solve this problem with only trivial math.<br>
	We know that if there are 4 dice each with 6 faces, the minimum value is 4 and the max is 24.  The most common values are closer to the middle of the distribution, in this case 14, is most common.  20 is closer to the middle than 21, so 20 is more likely to occure.<br>
	B) The ratio of palindromes to non-palindromes is
	$$
	\dfrac{26^{ceil(n/2)}}{26^{n}}
	$$
	where ceil mean round up if there is a remainder
<summary>Explaination</summary>
</details>

<h2>Question 29</h2>
<details>
	$$
	\dfrac{{n \choose k} \cdot {N-n \choose m-k}}{{N \choose m}}
	$$
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	The denominator is straight forward.  There are \({N \choose m}\) ways to captur m of N elk.<br>
	For the numerator, we count the number of ways to select k from the n elk originially caught, then we multiply that by the number of ways to choose m-k new elk.

<h2>Question 30</h2>
<details>
	The following sentence "find the probability that exactly <em>j</em> of your guesses are correct" is ambiguous because it does not specify how many guesses we had total.  For this question, we will assume you have exactly <em>j</em> guesses.
	<summary>Clarification</summary>
</details>
<details>
	$$
	\dfrac{1}{{4 \choose 2}}^j = \dfrac{1}{6}^j
	$$
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	We have 4 cards and we must choose the correct 2 cards, this means we will be corret \(\dfrac{1}{6}\)th of the time.
	<summary></summary>
</details>

<h2>Question 31</h2>
<details>
	A) Intuitivly, we know that the probability of the second ball being green is the same as the first because we can pretend that we selected the balls at the same time and the question is the same.<br>
	B)
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>

<h2>Question 33</h2>
<details>
	{13 \choose 3}^3 \cdot {13 \choose 4} \cdot 4
	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	If we have <em>at least</em> 3 of each suite and 13 cards total, that means we have 3 of 3 suites and 4 of one suite.<br>
	Because we can choose any of the 4 suites to have 4 of, we multiply by 4.
