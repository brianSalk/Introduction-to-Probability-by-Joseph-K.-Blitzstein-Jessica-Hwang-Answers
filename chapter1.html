<h2>Question 5</h2>
<details>
	A knock-out tournament is being held with \(2^n\) tennis players. This means that for each
round, the winners move on to the next round and the losers are eliminated, until only
one person remains. For example, if initially there are \(2^4 = 16) players, then there are
8 games in the first round, then the 8 winners move on to round 2, then the 4 winners
move on to round 3, then the 2 winners move on to round 4, the winner of which is
declared the winner of the tournament. (There are various systems for determining who
plays whom within a round, but these do not matter for this problem.)<br><br>
(a) How many rounds are there?<br>
(b) Count how many games in total are played, by adding up the numbers of games
played in each round.<br>
(c) Count how many games in total are played, this time by directly thinking about it

<h2>Question 6</h2>
<details>
	There are 20 people at a chess club on a certain day. They each find opponents and
start playing. How many possibilities are there for how they are matched up, assuming
that in each game it does matter who has the white pieces (in a chess game, one player
has the white pieces and the other player has the black pieces)?
	<summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
	$$
	2 {20 \choose 2}

	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	There are 20 players and we are counting pairs of players, that is how we got \({20 \choose 2}\), then we need to count the possibility that each player is either black or white, that gives us the \(2\).

<!--Question7-->
<h2>Question 7</h2>
<details>
	Two chess players, A and B, are going to play 7 games. Each game has three possible
outcomes: a win for A (which is a loss for B), a draw (tie), and a loss for A (which is
a win for B). A win is worth 1 point, a draw is worth 0.5 points, and a loss is worth 0
points.<br><br>
(a) How many possible outcomes for the individual games are there, such that overall
player A ends up with 3 wins, 2 draws, and 2 losses?<br>
(b) How many possible outcomes for the individual games are there, such that A ends
up with 4 points and B ends up with 3 points?<br>
(c) Now assume that they are playing a best-of-7 match, where the match will end as
soon as either player has 4 points. For example, if after 6 games the score is 4 to 2 in
favor of A, then A wins the match and they don’t play a 7th game. How many possible
outcomes for the individual games are there, such that the match lasts for 7 games and
A wins by a score of 4 to 3?<br>

</details>
<details>
	A) Use multinomial coefficient because we have 3 different outcomes, 3 wins, 2 loses and 2 ties.<br>
	B) We count all the ways player a gets 4 wins and player b gets 3 wins out of 7 games.  Because there are no ties, this is just 7 choose 4 (or 7 choose 3)<br>
	C) Because we must play 7 games and player a must win 4 to 3, the 7th game must be won by player a.  There are 6 choose 3 ways for her to win the other games.

	(a) How many paths are there from the point (0, 0) to the point (110, 111) in the

(b) How many paths are there from (0, 0) to (210, 211), where each step consists of going
one unit up or one unit to the right, and the path has to go through (110, 111)?

	B)
	$$
	{110 + 111 \choose 110} \cdot {200 \choose 100}
	$$
<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	A) 
	To find the number of paths from \( (x_1,y_1) \) to \( (x_2, y_2) \) on a grid, you count the ways you can use:
	$$
	{x_2 - x_1 + y_2 - y_1 \choose x_2 - x_1}
	$$
	because you need to sideways \(x_2 - x_1\) times and up or down \( y_2 - y_1 \) times.  <br>
	You must go up and right an additional 100, but still need to cross (110, 111), so multiply part a by:
	$$
	{200 \choose 100}

<h2>Question 10</h2>
<details>
	To fulfill the requirements for a certain degree, a student can choose to take any 7 out
of a list of 20 courses, with the constraint that at least 1 of the 7 courses must be a
statistics course. Suppose that 5 of the 20 courses are statistics courses.
(a) How many choices are there for which 7 courses to take?
(b) Explain intuitively why the answer to (a) is not \({5 \choose 1} \cdot {19 \choose 6}\).

<details>
	A)
	$$
	\sum_{i=1}^{5} {5 \choose i} \cdot {15 \choose 7-i}
	$$
	OR
	$$
	{20 \choose 7} - {15 \choose 7}
	$$
	B) The provided solution is wrong because when we choose 6 from 19, we might choose the same one we selected from the stats class.  In other words, this approach chooses one class twice.
<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	A) We can either do case work, selected 1 of the 5 stats courses then 6 of the remaining courses.  Then 2 of the stats courses and 5 of the remaining 15 courses and so on, but a simpler approach is to just subtract all the combinations including no stats courses from all possible combinations.<br>

Cersei are sitting next to each other? Find this in two ways:<br><br>
(a) using a sample space of size 12!, where an outcome is fully detailed about the seating;<br>
(b) using a much smaller sample space, which focuses on Tyrion and Cersei.<br>

	{n \choose j} {n-j \choose k - 2j} 2^{k-2j}

	<summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
	There are \(j\) ways to choose from the \(n\) couples, giving us \({n \choose j}\) <br>
	There are \(n-j\) remaining couples and we choose \(k-2j\) of them, giving us \({n-j \choose k-2j}\) <br>
	For each remaining couple, there are \(2\) people we can choose, giving us \(2^{k-2j}\)

(b) What is the probability that the sequence obtained is increasing? (Note: In this
book, “increasing” means “nondecreasing”.)
