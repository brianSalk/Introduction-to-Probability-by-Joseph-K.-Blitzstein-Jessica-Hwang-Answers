  A)
  $$
  4 \left( \dfrac{ \sum_{i=0}^{52} {}^{(52-12-4)}P_{i} \cdot (52-i-1)! }{52!} \right) = \dfrac{1}{4}
  $$
  B)
  $$
  4^4 \left( \dfrac{ \sum_{i=3}^{39} 3! {i \choose 3} {}^{(52 - 16)}P_{(i-3)} (52-i-1)!}{52!}\right) \approx 0.035

    A)<br>
  this is a complicated equation with a simple answer.  Let's look at each numbe and break it down.<br>
  the denominator is \(52!\) because that is the number of ways a deck of 52 cards can be shuffled.<br>
  the 12 comes from the total number of cards that cannot appear before our first ace (4 Jacks, 4 Queens and 4 Kings).<br>
  4 is the number of Aces<br>
  i represents the number of cards appearing before the first Ace.  We increment i and add all the possible permutations with an Ace in that position.
    <br>B)<br>
    This time we want to count how many ways we can have exactly 1 Jack, 1 Queen, and 1 Ace.  
    Our lower bound for i in the sigma notation starts at 3 and ends at 39.  i represents the number of cards appearing before our fist Ace.  
    Because we need 1 Jack,Queen and King; we use \({i \choose 3}\) to count the positions where we can put King Jack and Ace.  
    Then we multiply that by \(3!\) to count the permutations of the three cards.  
    Now all that is to count permutations of remaning cards to the left and right of the Ace.  
    for the left side we use \({}^{(52-16)}P_{(i-3})\), for the right we use \((52-i-i)!\)

    $$
    \dfrac{12 \cdot 2 10!}{12!} = \dfrac{6}{33}
    $$
    B)
    $$
    \dfrac{12}{{12 \choose 2}} = \dfrac{12}{66} = \dfrac{6}{33}

    A)<br>
    There are 12 positions where both Tyrion and Cerecei are next to each other, and we multiply that by 2 because we want to count how each one could sit on the right or left of the other.<br>
    Once we place both of them, there are \(10!\) ways that the other 10 people can be seated.  <br>
    There are \(12!\) total permutations, including rotations and reflections.<br><br>
    B)<br>
    We can simplify this and just count the number of positions the two can be seated at, then divide that by the total pairings possible.
