    A)<br>
  this is a complicated equation with a simple answer.  Let's look at each numbe and break it down.<br>
  the denominator is \(52!\) because that is the number of ways a deck of 52 cards can be shuffled.<br>
  the 12 comes from the total number of cards that cannot appear before our first ace (4 Jacks, 4 Queens and 4 Kings).<br>
  4 is the number of Aces<br>
  i represents the number of cards appearing before the first Ace.  We increment i and add all the possible permutations with an Ace in that position.
    <br>B)<br>
    This time we want to count how many ways we can have exactly 1 Jack, 1 Queen, and 1 Ace.  
    Our lower bound for i in the sigma notation starts at 3 and ends at 39.  i represents the number of cards appearing before our fist Ace.  
    Because we need 1 Jack,Queen and King; we use \({i \choose 3}\) to count the positions where we can put King Jack and Ace.  
    Then we multiply that by \(3!\) to count the permutations of the three cards.  
    Now all that is to count permutations of remaning cards to the left and right of the Ace.  
    for the left side we use \({}^{(52-16)}P_{(i-3})\), for the right we use \((52-i-i)!\)

    \dfrac{12}{{12 \choose 2}} = \dfrac{12}{66} = \dfrac{6}{33}

    A)<br>
    There are 12 positions where both Tyrion and Cerecei are next to each other, and we multiply that by 2 because we want to count how each one could sit on the right or left of the other.<br>
    Once we place both of them, there are \(10!\) ways that the other 10 people can be seated.  <br>
    There are \(12!\) total permutations, including rotations and reflections.<br><br>
    B)<br>
    We can simplify this and just count the number of positions the two can be seated at, then divide that by the total pairings possible.

<details>
	<summary>Explanation</summary>
	A)<br>
	Here we use \(n^k\) for the denominator because we draw \(k\) times from \(n\) balls,<br>
	The numerator is \(n \choose k\) because we do not want to count all permutations and we only want to count unique numbers (stricktly increasing).<br><br>
	B)<br>
	The numerator uses stars and bars this time, this is because we can draw the same ball multiple times.  Notice there is no 0 case this time, k can be less then, equal to, or greater than n.<br>

<details>
	It is important to remember to lable the buckets, and the order of the balls matter.  That gives us a denominator of \(n^n\).  For the numerator, we must realize that there is one empty bucket and one bucket with two balls.  Also the order of balls in the buckets with 1 ball matter (bucket 2 getting filled first is different then bucket 3 getting filled first, even if the end result looks the same)

	First off, the question does not explicitly state that words must not actually be valid English words, abcd is a no repeate word, so is wxyz.  Since there are \(26!\) 26 letter words, the numerator is straight forward.  The denominator is the sum of the number of all no-repeat words from length 1 to 26 inclusive.

<h2>Question 41</h2>
<details>
	Show that for any events A and B,
	$$
	P(A) + P (B) − 1 \le P (A \cap B) \le P (A \cup B) \le P (A) + P (B).
	$$ .
For each of these three inequalities, give a simple criterion for when the inequality is
actually an equality (e.g., give a simple condition such that P (A \ B) = P (A [ B) if
and only if the condition holds).
	<summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
	Let's see why these inequalities hold true.
	$$
	P(A) + P (B) − 1 \le P (A \cap B)
	$$ .
	For two events A and B in the same sample space, The intersection is at most equal to max(P(A), P(B)) and at least max(0, |P(A)-P(B)|-1).  Therefore, It is not possible for P(A) + P(B) -1 to be greater than \(P(A\cap B)\).  If P(A) = 1 and P(B) = 1, then this becomes an equality
	$$
	P (A \cap B) \le P (A \cup B)
	$$
	This one is more straight forward because the probability of two events happening at the same time can never be more than either event happening. Once again, when P(A) and P(B) both equal 1, these are the same.  Also if the both equal 0
	$$
	P (A \cup B) \le P (A) + P (B)
	$$
	This is true because inclusion-exclusion principle.  When we do P(A)+P(B), we are counting the intersection of the two events twice.  Whenever A and B are disjoint, this will be an equality.

	To prove this we can use the Law Of Total Probabilities.  Which means that for each i \(A_i \in B\), the following holds true:
	$$
	\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i = B
	$$
	Now just let \(A\) be one of the \(A_i\), which is the same as \(B-A\)

	First we add all the ways that we can get all but one value, then multiply it by 6 because that is how many values we have<br>
	but then we need to subtract all the values we accidentally added twice because there are 2 values absent, then we add all the ways we accidentally subtracted when 3 values were absent and so on.
