  You would be forgiven for thinking this is a complicated answer.  Let's look at each numbe and break it down.<br>
  the denominator is \(52!\) because that is the number of ways a deck of 52 cards can be shuffled.<br>
  the 12 comes from the total number of cards that cannot appear before our first ace (4 Jacks, 4 Queens and 4 Kings).<br>
  4 is the number of Aces<br>
  i represents the number of cards appearing before the first Ace.  We increment i and add all the possible permutations with an Ace in that position.
