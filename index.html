<h2>Question 3</h2>
<details>According to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), men who smoke are
23 times more likely to develop lung cancer than men who donâ€™t smoke, Also according
to the CDC, 21.6% of men in the U.S. smoke, What is the probability that a man in
the U.S. is a smoker, given that he develops lung cancer?
<summary>Question</summary></details>

<details>$$P(S|C)=\dfrac{\frac{23}{24} \cdot .216}{.239\overline{6}}\approx.864$$<summary>Answer</summary></details>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <details>$$S=is\_smoker$$ $$C=has\_cancer$$ $$P(S)=.216$$ $$P(C|S)=23/24$$ 

  $$P(S|C)=\dfrac{P(C|S)P(S)}{P(C)}$$ $$P(C) = P(C|S)P(S) + P(C|S^c)P(S^c)$$ plugging in our values from above, we get                                                                                        $$P(C) = \frac{23}{24}\cdot .216 + \frac{1}{24} \cdot .784 = .239\overline{6}$$ our final equation is                                                                                                        $$P(S|C)=\dfrac{23/24 \cdot .216}{.239\overline{6}}\approx.864$$                                                                                                                                                Notice that we do not actually know what the rate of cancer is.  Knowing that smokers are 23 times more likely to get cancer is enough for us to answer this question.<summary>Explaination</summary></details>
