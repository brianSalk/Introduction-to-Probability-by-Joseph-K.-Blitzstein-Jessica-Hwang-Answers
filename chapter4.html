    Don't overthink this.  If one die has an expected value of \(3.5\), then \(4\) must have expected value of \(14\).  
    In other words, you just multiply the answer to part A by \(4\).

<h2>Question 4</h2>
<details>
    A fair die is rolled some number of times. You can choose whether to stop after 1, 2, or
3 rolls, and your decision can be based on the values that have appeared so far. You
receive the value shown on the last roll of the die, in dollars. What is your optimal
strategy (to maximize your expected winnings)? Find the expected winnings for this
strategy.<br><br>
Hint: Start by considering a simpler version of this problem, where there are at most 2
rolls. For what values of the first roll should you continue for a second roll?
    <summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
    The best strategy is to stop rolling if your first roll is a 5 or 6,<br>
    and stop rolling if your second roll is a 4, 5, or 6<br><br>
    ```math
    X(best_strategy) \approx 4.66\overline{6}
    ```
    <summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
    To find our strategy, we need to know what the expected value of the remaining flips is.  
    If the value of the current roll is better than the expected max value of the remaining roll, you should stop rolling and take the money.<br>
    $$
    E(MAX(2flips)) \approx 4.47
    $$
    $$
    E((MAX(1flip)) = 3.5
    $$
    Using the above, we should only stop after the first flip if it is greater than 4.47 and after the second flip if it is greater than 3.5<br>
    We an calculate the expeced value of this new strategy by finding the probability that we stop on a given roll, multiplied by the expected value of that roll.<br>
    let \(p_j\) be the probability that we stop on roll \(j\) and \(v_j\) be the expected value when we stop on that roll.<br>
    \(p_1 = \dfrac{1}{3}\)<br>
    \(p_2 = \dfrac{2}{3} \cdot \dfrac{1}{2}\)<br>
    \(p_3 = p2\)<br>
   \(v_1 = \dfrac{5+6}{2}\)<br> 
    \(v_1 = \dfrac{4+5+6}{3}\)<br> 
    \(v_1 = \dfrac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6}\)<br> 
    which gives us the equation:
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{3} v_ip_i = 4 \dfrac{2}{3}

    E(X) = 5.8125

    V(X) \approx 1.03
    $$
    <summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
    We use the binomial distribution to solve this type of problem because win probabilities are independant.<br>
    There is a 'tricks' <br>
    We must find the different ways for each team to win \(3\) games out of \(6\), not \(4\) out of \(7\).  This is because we already know the winning team wins the last game.<br>
    $$
    p_4 = {3 \choose 3} p^3 q^0 = .125
    $$
    $$
    p_5 = {4 \choose 3} p^3 q^1 = .25
    $$
    $$
    p_6 = {5 \choose 3} p^3 q^2 = .3125
    $$
    $$
    p_7 = {6 \choose 3} p^3 q^3 = .3125
    $$
    So the mean is:<br>
    $$
    \sum_{n=4}^{7} n \cdot p_n = 5.8125
    $$
    Using the above information, we can find the variance.
    $$
    var(X) = \sum_{i=4}^{7} (i - \mu) \cdot p_i
    $$
    Where \(\mu\) represents the mean found in the previous answer.

    A)
    $$
    E(X) = .15
    $$
    $$
    VAR(X) = 0.472\overbar{2}
    $$
    B)
    $$
    X(X) \approx 1.58
    $$
    $$
    VAR(X) \approx .474
    $$
    I was surprised that these were different at all, my induition told me they would be the same!
    <summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
    A) we find the probability for each birth rank by multiplying the probability of selecting each family by the proportion of that rank within each family.<br>
    $$
    P(X) = \begin{cases}
    \dfrac{1}{3} + \dfrac{1}{6} + \dfrac{1/9}  & \text{if} x = 1 \\
    \dfrac{1}{6} + \dfrac{1}{9} & \text{if} x = 2 \\
    \dfrac{1}{9} & \text{if} x = 3
    \end{cases}
    $$
    Which gives us a mean of
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{3} i \cdot p_i = 1.5
    $$
    and a variance of 
    $$
    \frac{11}{18}(1-1.5)^2 + \frac{5}{18}(2-1.5)^2 + \frac{1}{9}(3-1.5)^2 = .47\overbar{2}
    $$
    B) all 100 families have a first child, 70 have a second, and 20 have a third.<br>
    $$
    p(c_1) = \dfrac{100}{190} = \dfrac{10}{19}
    $$
    $$
    p(c_2) = \dfrac{70}{190} = \dfrac{7}{19}
    $$
    $$
    p(c_3) = \dfrac{20}{190} = \dfrac{2}{19}
    $$
    so our PMF is 
    $$
    p(X) = \begin{cases}
    \frac{10}{19} &  \text{if} x=1 \\
    \frac{7}{19} & \text{if} x=2 \\
    \frac{2}{19} & \text{if} x=3
    \end{cases}
    $$
    Which allows us to calculate the mean.
    $$
    \mu = \dfrac{10}{19} + \dfrac{14}{19} + \dfrac{6}{19} \approx 1.58
    $$
    Now we can use the mean to calculate variance
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{3} (i-\mu)^2 p_i \approx .4737
    $$

<h2>Question 8</h2>
<details>
    A certain country has four regions: North, East, South, and West. The populations of
these regions are 3 million, 4 million, 5 million, and 8 million, respectively. There are 4
cities in the North, 3 in the East, 2 in the South, and there is only 1 city in the West.
Each person in the country lives in exactly one of these cities.<br><br>
    (a) What is the average size of a city in the country? (This is the arithmetic mean of
the populations of the cities, and is also the expected value of the population of a city
chosen uniformly at random.)
Hint: Give the cities names (labels).<br>
(b) Show that without further information it is impossible to find the variance of the
population of a city chosen uniformly at random. That is, the variance depends on how
the people within each region are allocated between the cities in that region.<br>
(c) A region of the country is chosen uniformly at random, and then a city within that
region is chosen uniformly at random. What is the expected population size of this
randomly chosen city?
Hint: To help organize the calculation, start by finding the PMF of the population size
of the city.<br>
    (d) Explain intuitively why the answer to (c) is larger than the answer to (a).
    <summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
    A)
    $$
    \mu = \dfrac{20,000,000}{10} = 2,000,000
    $$
    B)
    Unlike the mean, we need to know the exact population of each city in order to calculate the variance.<br>
    C)
    To solve this, we must know the mean size of a city in each region and the probability of choosing that region
    $$
    P(X) = \begin{cases}
    \dfrac{1}{4} & \text{if} x = 750,000 \\
    \dfrac{1}{4} & \text{if} x = 1,333,333.\overbar{3} \\
    \dfrac{1}{4} & \text{if} x = 2,500,000 \\
    \dfrac{1}{4} & \text{if} x = 8,000,000
    \end{end}
    $$
    So the expected value of the chosen city is
    $$
    \dfrac{750,000}{4} + \dfrac{1,333,333.\overbar{3}}{4} + \dfrac{2,500,000}{4} + \dfrac{8,000,000}{4} = 3,145,833.33\overbar{3}
    $$
    D)
    $$
    In part C, there is a \(\frac{1}{4}\)th chance of selecting a city with \(8,000,000\) people in it, while part A has equal chance of selecting any city.<br>
    By putting all the low population cities in 1 region you make them impact the mean less.  This is how jerrymandering works.

<h2>Question 9</h2>
<details>
    Consider the following simplified scenario based on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?,
a game show in which the contestant answers multiple-choice questions that have 4
choices per question. The contestant (Fred) has answered 9 questions correctly already,
and is now being shown the 10th question. He has no idea what the right answers are
to the 10th or 11th questions are. He has one “lifeline” available, which he can apply
on any question, and which narrows the number of choices from 4 down to 2. Fred has
the following options available.<br><br>
(a) Walk away with $16,000.<br>
(b) Apply his lifeline to the 10th question, and then answer it. If he gets it wrong, he
will leave with $1,000. If he gets it right, he moves on to the 11th question. He then
leaves with $32,000 if he gets the 11th question wrong, and $64,000 if he gets the
11th question right.<br>
(c) Same as the previous option, except not using his lifeline on the 10th question, and
instead applying it to the 11th question (if he gets the 10th question right).<br><br>
Find the expected value of each of these options. Which option has the highest expected
value? Which option has the lowest variance?
    <summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
    The expected value is the probability of the event happening times the value of the event.
    $$
    E(walk) = 16,000
    $$
    $$
    E(lifeline10) = \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot 1,000 + \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot \dfrac{3}{4} \cdot 32,000 + \dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{1}{4} 64,000 = 20,500
    $$
    $$
    E(lifeline11) = \dfrac{3}{4} * 1,000 + \dfrac{1}{4} \dfrac{1}{2} 16,000 + \dfrac{1}{4} \cdot \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot 64,000 = 28,750
    $$
    using your lifeline on the \(11^{th}\) question leads to the highest expected value, but just walking and taking the $\(16,000\) has the least variance.<br>

<h2>Question 11</h2>
<details>
    Martin has just heard about the following exciting gambling strategy: bet $1 that a
fair coin will land Heads. If it does, stop. If it lands Tails, double the bet for the next
toss, now betting $2 on Heads. If it does, stop. Otherwise, double the bet for the next
toss to $4. Continue in this way, doubling the bet each time and then stopping right
after winning a bet. Assume that each individual bet is fair, i.e., has an expected net
winnings of 0. The idea is that
    $$
    2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1
    $$
so the gambler will be $1 ahead after winning a bet, and then can walk away with a
profit.
Martin decides to try out this strategy. However, he only has $31, so he may end up
walking away bankrupt rather than continuing to double his beg.  On average, how much money will Martin win?
