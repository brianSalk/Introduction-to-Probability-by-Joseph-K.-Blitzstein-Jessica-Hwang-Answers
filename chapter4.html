<h2>Question 1</h2>
<details>
    Bobo, the amoeba from Chapter 2, currently lives alone in a pond. After one minute
Bobo will either die, split into two amoebas, or stay the same, with equal probability.
Find the expectation and variance for the number of amoebas in the pond after one
minute.

    We have \(3\) events \(E_1 = 0\), \(E_2 = 1\) and, \(E_3 = 2\) each with an equal probability of occuring \(p_1 = \frac{1}{3}\), \(p_2 = \frac{1}{3}\), \(p_3 = \frac{1}{3}\).

<h2>Question 2</h2>

    In the Gregorian calendar, each year has either 365 days (a normal year) or 366 days
(a leap year). A year is randomly chosen, with probability 3/4 of being a normal year
and 1/4 of being a leap year. Find the mean and variance of the number of days in the
chosen year

    (a) A fair die is rolled. Find the expected value of the roll.<br><br>

    A)
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^6 \dfrac{i}{6} = 3.5
    $$
    B)
    $$
    3.5 \cdot 4 = 14
    $$
    Don't overthink this.  If one die has an expected value of \(3.5\), then \(4\) must have expected value of \(14\).  
    In other words, you just multiply the answer to part A by \(4\).

<h2>Question 4</h2>
<details>
    A fair die is rolled some number of times. You can choose whether to stop after 1, 2, or
3 rolls, and your decision can be based on the values that have appeared so far. You
receive the value shown on the last roll of the die, in dollars. What is your optimal
strategy (to maximize your expected winnings)? Find the expected winnings for this
strategy.<br><br>
Hint: Start by considering a simpler version of this problem, where there are at most 2
rolls. For what values of the first roll should you continue for a second roll?
    <summary>Question</summary>
</details>
<details>
    The best strategy is to stop rolling if your first roll is a 5 or 6,<br>
    and stop rolling if your second roll is a 4, 5, or 6<br><br>
    ```math
    X(best_strategy) \approx 4.66\overline{6}
    ```
    <summary>Answer</summary>
</details>
<details>
    To find our strategy, we need to know what the expected value of the remaining flips is.  
    If the value of the current roll is better than the expected max value of the remaining roll, you should stop rolling and take the money.<br>
    $$
    E(MAX(2flips)) \approx 4.47
    $$
    $$
    E((MAX(1flip)) = 3.5
    $$
    Using the above, we should only stop after the first flip if it is greater than 4.47 and after the second flip if it is greater than 3.5<br>
    We an calculate the expeced value of this new strategy by finding the probability that we stop on a given roll, multiplied by the expected value of that roll.<br>
    let \(p_j\) be the probability that we stop on roll \(j\) and \(v_j\) be the expected value when we stop on that roll.<br>
    \(p_1 = \dfrac{1}{3}\)<br>
    \(p_2 = \dfrac{2}{3} \cdot \dfrac{1}{2}\)<br>
    \(p_3 = p2\)<br>
   \(v_1 = \dfrac{5+6}{2}\)<br> 
    \(v_1 = \dfrac{4+5+6}{3}\)<br> 
    \(v_1 = \dfrac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6}\)<br> 
    which gives us the equation:
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{3} v_ip_i = 4 \dfrac{2}{3}
    $$

    finding the expected value)<br>
    expected value of a distribution is the mean.  There are many ways to calculate the mean of a uniform distribution that starts at \(1\)<br>
    $$
    \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^}{n}}{n} = \dfrac{ {n \choose } }{}
