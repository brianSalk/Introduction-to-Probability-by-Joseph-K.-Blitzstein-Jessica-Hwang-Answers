<h2>Question 1</h2>
<details>
    Bobo, the amoeba from Chapter 2, currently lives alone in a pond. After one minute
Bobo will either die, split into two amoebas, or stay the same, with equal probability.

<details>
    We have \(3\) events \(E_1 = 0\), \(E_2 = 1\) and, \(E_3 = 2\) each with an equal probability of occuring \(p_1 = \frac{1}{3}\), \(p_2 = \frac{1}{3}\), \(p_3 = \frac{1}{3}\).

<h2>Question 2</h2>
<details>
    In the Gregorian calendar, each year has either 365 days (a normal year) or 366 days
(a leap year). A year is randomly chosen, with probability 3/4 of being a normal year
and 1/4 of being a leap year. Find the mean and variance of the number of days in the
chosen year
